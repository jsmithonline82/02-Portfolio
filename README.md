# 02-Portfolio

For this Homework I met the requirements listed to the best of my knowledge

I have index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

I used Bootstrap

I have a Nav Bar

I have a responsive layout and images

I did not use media queries

--------------------------------

I added a section for a musical portfolio

I used iFrame to integrate my existing Real Estate web site

I used RGBA for background opacity

I used a custom font

I included social media links

I attempted to use sub columns in the portfolio section

I had some quirky issues with background image, had to turn to a custom .css

I took the background image myself, so I should be okay to use it I assume.
